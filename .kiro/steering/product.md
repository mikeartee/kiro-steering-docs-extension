# Product Overview

This is a VS Code extension that enables browsing, previewing, and installing Kiro steering documents from a GitHub repository. The extension provides a tree view in the Explorer sidebar where users can:

- Browse available steering documents organized by category
- Preview document content before installation
- Install documents to the local `.kiro/steering/` directory
- Manage document inclusion modes (always, manual, fileMatch)
- Check for and install updates to installed documents
- Quick load documents with automatic activation

The extension acts as a package manager for Kiro steering documents, making it easy to discover and adopt community-created steering rules and conventions.
